# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Analysis on Richest People Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data analysis on an Excel dataset containing information about the world's richest people. The dataset includes attributes such as net worth, age, country, and industry.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is provided in an Excel file named `richest_people.xlsx` with the following columns:

- `Name`: The name of the individual.
- `Net Worth (Billion USD)`: The net worth of the individual in billion USD.
- `Age`: The age of the individual.
- `Country`: The country of residence or origin of the individual.
- `Industry`: The primary industry in which the individual has accumulated their wealth.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**: Inspect and clean the dataset to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and incorrect entries.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute basic statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.
3. **Visualizations**: Create charts and graphs to identify trends and patterns in the data.

## Steps for Analysis

### 1. Load the Data

Open the `richest_people.xlsx` file in Excel. Review the data to understand its structure and content.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- **Check for Missing Values**: Identify and address any missing values in the dataset.
- **Correct Data Types**: Ensure that each column has the correct data type (e.g., numerical values for net worth and age).
- **Remove Duplicates**: Check for and remove any duplicate rows.

### 3. Descriptive Statistics

- **Summary Statistics**: Use Excel functions to compute mean, median, standard deviation, and range for columns like net worth and age.
- **Frequency Counts**: Calculate the frequency of occurrences for categorical variables like country and industry.

### 4. Visualizations

- **Histograms**: Create histograms to visualize the distribution of net worth and age.
- **Bar Charts**: Generate bar charts to show average net worth by country and industry.
- **Pie Charts**: Use pie charts to display the proportion of individuals from different industries or countries.

## Results and Insights

- **Net Worth Distribution**: Insights into how net worth is distributed among the richest individuals.
- **Age vs. Net Worth**: Analysis of how age correlates with net worth.
